                This little owl is most active at dusk, but also partly active by day, and at night. Often roosts by day in dense foliage or openings of holes. When disturbed at roost, it adopts a slim, upright position, then bobs its body up and down. If still threatened, it will fly away, or withdraw into a nearby hole. Avoids forest.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                Feed on insects. Surplus food is stored in caches, generally in holes.
            </p>
            <p class="description">Little Owls may reach an age of about 16 years, but normally do not live that long. Many individuals are hit by vehicles when hunting at night. Severe winters with a lot of snow may also lead to huge losses in some populations.
